A weekend hack to wire up a [Particle Photon](http://particle.io) WiFi module to an apartment building's intercom system allowing you to wirelessly unlock the building's front door.

## Hardware Parts List

Required:
(1) Particle Photon module<br />
(1) 3v 50mA relay<br />
(1) NPN transistor<br />

Wire

Optional:
(1) Photon Internet Button kit<br />

## Hardware Assembly

Connect Particle Photo to relay using the below schematic:

![schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanh/frontdoor/master/private/images/schematic.jpg)

Connect relay's _normally open_ terminal and one of relay's _common_ terminals to contacts on intercom that normally are shorted together when user pushes "door" button.

Close intercom panel.

NOTE: you'll have to find some way to power the Particle module. I've run 5v DC inside the wall.

Program Particle Photon module with script included in
`private/particle/front-door.ino`. If not using Photon
Internet Button carrier board, make certain to comment
outline or remove lines that reference/use Internet Button's LED lighting.

## Software Installation:

1. Install [meteor](http://www.meteor.com) framework
2. Clone this repository
